# DPOpenData
Project to have European DPA (Data Processing Authority) to release all Data Processors and their DPO contact as OpenData

The French DPA (CNIL) released an Open Data set made of Data Processors (the private or public organization processing data, that appointed a DPO) and the corresponding contact of the appointed DPO. See https://www.cnil.fr/fr/opendata .

That enable a variety of actions facilitating the enforcement of citizens GDPR rights.

The DPOpenData project aim to:

1. Lobby on all the EU's DPA to proactively follow the CNIL's example releasing the same OpenData set
2. Lobby the EDPB (European Data Proection Board) to define a common OpenData standard to facilitate aggregation of OpenData
2. Issue a FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) request to all the DPA to requests the above mentioned data to get public

The full list of EU's DPA and their corresponding contact is available at https://www.gdprregister.eu/gdpr/dpa-gdpr/ .

The action group will coordinate trough a [Telegram Group Chat](https://t.me/DPOpenData)

## Action Plan
The action plan of the project works as above

a) Preliminarly develop the mapping schema

b) Engage and coordinate country-level EDRi NGO members requesting a support 

c) Develop a common FOIA request and send them to all the DPA

d) Keep tracks of the requests/responses
