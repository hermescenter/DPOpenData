Freedom of Information Act Request for Data Processors and DPO Contacts collected by the Data Protection Authority

PREMISE

Pursuant to Article 37 paragraph 1 letter a and part 7 of the GDPR, Data Controllers must notify the DPO, and for this purpose the GDPR has set up special telematic modes of communication referred to at https://servizi.gpdp.it/comunicazionerpd/s/ .

It is worth mentioning that the French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) has already arranged for the automatic publication, in OpenData, of all Data Controllers who have disclosed the DPO, via dataset accessible at https://www.cnil.fr/fr/opendata.

Il Centro Hermes per la Trasparenza e i Diritti Umani Digitali si porta promotore della iniziativa di liberare tali dataset da parte di tutte le DPA (Data Protection Authority Europee) avviando il progetto DPOpenData (Project to have European DPA to release all Data Processors and their DPO contact as OpenData https://github.com/hermescenter/DPOpenData) invitando le medesime a seguire il virtuoso esempio del CNIL e richiedendone lâ€™accesso per tramite dei diritti di accesso civico generalizzato (FOIA).
